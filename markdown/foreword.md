# Foreword

This document specifies the Finnish data exchange requirements of a route based on IFC 4.3.2.0 (IFC4X3_ADD2).
Examples of route include road, street, walkway railway and waterway.
This documents excludes domain specific content of rail- and waterways (such as cant and km-posting). 
Also the content of this specification is limited to define:

- Geometry of a route
- Structural model of a route
- Existing terrain and rock bed
- Earthworks cuts and fills

Following data exchange use cases are covered by this specification:

- Quantity takeoff (bSF_QTO)
- Design to construction (bSF_D2C)
- Digital handover (bSF_DH)

LandXML based Inframodel format is widely used in Finland for the data excange use cases mentioned above.However, it is based on aging LandXML which is setting some limititations for the design file content. For this reason, many different types of documents (ie. drawings, spreadsheets, pdf) are typically used together with Inframodel. On the other hand, IFC 4.3 provides too diverse set of features to be properly machine processed, unless further rules are applied.This document defines an minimal subset of IFC4.3 functionality which cover the defined data exchange use cases. Transition to IFC-based data exchange would allow machine readable feature rich communication.

## Data exchange use cases

In all three use cases the exchange of information is limited to covering superstructures, surface structures, structural layers and geometry lines of the route.

### Quantity takeoff (bSF_QTO)

This use case describes the exchange of quantity information required for cost calculation. The specification includes the quantity information required in both design and construction phases, as well as a description of the required geometric representation.

### Design to construction (bSF_D2C)

This use case describes the exchange of information between construction plan phase and the construction phase. The specification includes attributes, properties and geometric representation that allow surveying and installing the structure on the site.

### Digital handover (bSF_DH)
This use case describes the road as-built information exchange to the customer's systems. The specification includes the necessary attributes, properties and geometric presentation that enable the information required by the subscriber to be transferred to the customer's systems, such as registers or asset management systems. 

## Presentation format

Wide range of technologies and tools are available to specify the content of an IFC file (mvd, ids and bsdd, etc.).
This specification is using diagrams for good human readability, machine readable format will follow later.
The diagrams are drawn applying "crow's foot notation" as explained below.

### Defining entities

IFC Entity types explicitly included in all the use cases mentioned above are shown in the diagrams in this document. They are either used "as-is" (i.e. with no use case specific rules), or with additional rules specified in this document. 
Entity types used "as-is" appear as white boxes, or as relationship names om links in case of short-hand notation for IfcRel-entities.
Entity types with additional rules appear as green boxes, if defined in the current diagram, or as blue boxes, if referenced from another diagram.
Addinonal rules may apply only in a paricular usage, in which case the IFC entity name is appended with a qualifier (e.g. IfcProductDefinitionShape-Alignment or IfcProductDefinitionShape-TIN). Otherwise, the rules on the Entity type apply globally.
These rules may:

- Change OPTIONAL attribute to MANDATORY
- Prohibit the use of OPTIONAL attribute (marked as $)
- Limit cardinality (usually allowing only one item in a list or a set)
- Applying value restrictions on attributes:
  - Fixed value or list of allowable values (enumerated or range)
  - Enumeration datatype having some of the enumeration items excluded
  - Entity datatypes excluded from allowable subtypes or select items


Attributes with no use case specific rules are omitted (and are to be used per standard IFC specification).

### Defining properties and property sets

Property sets and quantity sets (implemented as IfcPropertySet and IfcElementQuantity) applicable to each Entity type are defined as Protocol, if there is a subset selected from IFC specification, or if they are specified by bSF (Inframodel properties); Protocol is named as IfcPropertySet or IfcElementQuantity, appended with a qualifier). Otherwise, all those available for the Entity type in IFC specification are in scope. In case of Inframodel properties, the qualifier starts with "bSF".
The usage of individual properties in each use case may be set for property/quantity sets defined in this document (selection provided as table per property/quantity set in this document). If no selection is made, all properties are in scope by default. 

@startuml

protocol "IfcPropertySet-Course" <<DefinedInThisDiagram>>
{
    Pset_CourseCommon
    Pset_BoundedCourseCommon
    Pset_CourseApplicationConditions
}
note top of "IfcPropertySet-Course"
    Standard IFC property sets for Entity type.
    All included ones listed here.
    (Individual properties may be selected per use case).
end note

protocol "IfcPropertySet-bSFCourse" <<DefinedInAnotherDiagram>>
{
}

note top of "IfcPropertySet-bSFCourse"
    bSF (Inframodel) property sets for Entity type.
    List of included ones defined in another diagram.
end note

entity IfcElementQuantity <<UndefinedEntity>>
{
}

note top of IfcElementQuantity
    Standard IFC quantities for Entity type.
    All those defined in IFC specification are included.
end note

## Taxonomy/classification system(s)

In all three use cases, entities representing physical things and alignments are required to be classified using IfcClassicationRefence (use of InfraBIM classification system is strongly encouraged, others may be used in addition). Additionally, individual breaklines can be coded as part of geometry using IfcShapeAspect.
Each IfcClassicationRefence shall be linked to an IfcClassification identifying the source classification/coding system.
